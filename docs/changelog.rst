  that can contain arbitrary Python code, such as definition of a plugin. Eventually we'll add a plugin that allows
  succinct declaration/generation of new tox environments - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1963 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1963>`_)

- Add support for the ``install_command`` settings in the virtual env test environments - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1832 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1832>`_)
- Add support for the ``package_root`` \ ``setupdir`` ( Python scoped) configuration that sets the root directory used for
  packaging (the location of the historical ``setup.py`` and modern ``pyproject.toml``). This can be set at root level, or
  at tox environment level (the later takes precedence over the former) - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1838 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1838>`_)
- Implement support for the ``--installpkg`` CLI flag - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1839 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1839>`_)

- Do not construct a requirements file for deps in virtualenv, instead pass content as CLI argument to pip - by
  :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1906 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1906>`_)
- Do not display status update environment reports when interrupted or for the final environment ran (because at the
  final report will be soon printed and makes the status update redundant) - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1909 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1909>`_)
- The ``_TOX_SHOW_THREAD`` environment variable can be used to print alive threads when tox exists (useful to debug
  when tox hangs because of some non-finished thread) and also now prints the pid of the local subprocess when reporting

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Show config no longer marks as unused keys that are inherited (e.g. if the key is coming from ``testenv`` section and our
  target is ``testenv:fix``) - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1833 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1833>`_)
- ``--alwayscopy`` and ``--sitepackages`` legacy only flags do not work - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1839 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1839>`_)

  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1915 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1915>`_)

Deprecations and Removals - 4.0.0a6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- - Drop support for ``sdistsrc`` flag because introduces a significant complexity and is barely used (5 hits on a github
    search).
  - ``--skip-missing-interpreters``, ``--notest``, ``--sdistonly``, ``--installpkg``, ``--develop`` and
    ``--skip-pkg-install`` CLI flags are no longer available for ``devenv`` (enforce the only sane value for these).

  By :user:`gaborbernat` (`#1839 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1839>`_)
- Remove Jenkins override support: this feature goes against the spirit of tox - blurring the line between the CI and
  local runs. It also singles out a single CI provider, which opens the door for other CIs wanting similar functionality.
  Finally, only 54 code file examples came back on a Github search, showing this is a not widely used feature. People who
  still want Jenkins override support may create a tox plugin to achieve this functionality - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1841 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1841>`_)

- Support the ``always_copy``/``alwayscopy`` flag for virtual environment based tox environments -
  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1848 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1848>`_)
- Support the ``download`` flag for virtual environment based tox environments - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1849 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1849>`_)
- Recreate virtual environment based tox environments when the ``virtualenv`` version changes - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1865 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1865>`_)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Not all package dependencies are installed when different tox environments in the same run use different set of
  extras - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1868 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1868>`_)
- Support ``=`` separator in requirement file flags, directories as requirements and correctly set the root of the
  requirements file when using the ``--root`` CLI flag to change the root - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1853 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1853>`_)
- Cleanup local subprocess file handlers when exiting runs (fixes ``ResourceWarning: unclosed file`` errors when running
  with ``env PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=5 PYTHONDEVMODE=y`` under a Python built with ``--with-pydebug``)
  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1857 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1857>`_)
- Various small bugfixes:

  - honor updating default environment variables set by internal tox via set env (``PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK``)
  - do not multi-wrap ``HandledError`` in the ini file loader,
  - skipped environments are logged now with their fail message at default verbosity level,
  - fix an error that made the show configuration command crash when making the string of a config value failed,
  - support empty-new lines within the set env configurations replacements,

  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1864 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1864>`_)

v4.0.0a4 (2021-01-16)
---------------------

Features - 4.0.0a4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use ``.tox/4`` instead of ``.tox4`` folder (so ignores for tox 3 works for tox 4 too), reminder we'll rename this to
  just ``.tox`` before public release, however to encourage testing tox 4 in parallel with tox 3 this is helpful
  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1812 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1812>`_)
- Colorize the ``config`` command: section headers are yellow, keys are green, values remained white, exceptions are light
  red and comments are cyan - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1821 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1821>`_)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a4

  viewing inside the ``deps`` or calculating weather our environment is up to date or not - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1788 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1788>`_)
- When specifying requirements/editable/constraint paths within ``deps`` escape space, unless already escaped to support
  running specifying transitive requirements files within deps - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1792 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1792>`_)

  dependency error - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1821 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1821>`_)
- Raise ``ValueError`` with descriptive message when a requirements file specified does not exist
  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1828 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1828>`_)
- Support all valid requirement file specification without delimiting space in the ``deps`` of the ``tox.ini`` -
  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1834 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1834>`_)

Improved Documentation - 4.0.0a4

- - Raise exception when variable substitution enters into a circle.
  - Add ``{/}`` as substitution for os specific path separator.
  - Add ``{env_bin_dir}`` constant substitution.
  - Implement support for ``--discover`` flag - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1784 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1784>`_)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Entries in the ``set_env`` does not reference environments from ``set_env`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1776 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1776>`_)
- ``env`` substitution does not uses values from ``set_env`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1779 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1779>`_)
- Adopt tox 3 base pass env list, by adding:

  - on all platforms: ``LANG``, ``LANGUAGE``, ``CURL_CA_BUNDLE``, ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` , ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNLDE``,
  - on Windows: ``SYSTEMDRIVE`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1780 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1780>`_)
- Fixed a bug that crashed tox where calling tox with the recreate flag and when multiple environments were reusing the
  same package - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1782 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1782>`_)
- - Python version markers are stripped in package dependencies (after wrongfully being detected as an extra marker).
  - In packaging APIs do not set ``PYTHONPATH`` (to empty string) if ``backend-path`` is empty.
  - Fix commands parsing on Windows (do not auto-escape ``\`` - instead users should use the new ``{\}``, and on parsed
    arguments strip both ``'`` and ``"`` quoted outcomes).
  - Allow windows paths in substitution set/default (the ``:`` character used to separate substitution arguments may
    also be present in paths on Windows - do not support single capital letter values as substitution arguments) -
    by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1784 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1784>`_)
- Rework how we handle Python packaging environments:

  - the base packaging environment changed from ``.package`` to ``.pkg``,
  - merged the ``sdist``, ``wheel`` and ``dev`` separate packaging implementations into one, and internally dynamically
    pick the one that's needed,
  - the base packaging environment always uses the same Python environment as tox is installed into,
  - the base packaging environment is used to get the metadata of the project (via PEP-517) and to build ``sdist`` and
    ``dev`` packages,
  - for building wheels introduced a new per env configurable option ``wheel_build_env``, if the target Python major/minor
    and implementation for the run tox environment and the base package tox environment matches set this to ``.pkg``,
    otherwise this is ``.pkg-{implementation}{major}{minor}``,
  - internally now packaging environments can create further packaging environments they are responsible of managing,
  - updated ``depends`` to use the packaging logic,
  - add support skip missing interpreters for depends and show config,

  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1804 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1804>`_)

v4.0.0a1
--------
* First version all is brand new.

.. warning::

   The current tox is the second iteration of implementation. From version ``0.5`` all the way to ``3.X``
   we numbered the first iteration. Version ``4.0.0a1`` is a complete rewrite of the package, and as such this release
   history starts from there. The old changelog is still available in the
   `legacy branch documentation <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/legacy/changelog.html>`_.
