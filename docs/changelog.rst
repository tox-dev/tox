~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Allow passing in multiple overrides using the ``;`` character and fix ``,`` being used as splitting values -
  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`3112`)


v4.11.0 (2023-08-29)
--------------------

Features - 4.11.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add support for setting build backend ``config_settings`` in the configuration file - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`3090`)


v4.10.0 (2023-08-21)
--------------------

Features - 4.10.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Change accepted environment name rule: must be made up of factors defined in configuration or match regex
  ``(pypy|py|cython|)((\d(\.\d+(\.\d+)?)?)|\d+)?``. If an environment name does not match this fail, and if a close match
  found suggest that to the user. (:issue:`3099`)

Bugfixes - 4.10.0

Features - 4.8.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``--override`` can now take options in the form of ``foo+=bar`` which
  will append ``bar`` to the end of an existing list/dict, rather than

v4.7.0 (2023-08-08)
-------------------

Features - 4.7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Make --hashseed default to PYTHONHASHSEED, if defined - by :user:`paravoid`.
  The main motivation for this is to able to set the hash seed when building the
  documentation with "tox -e docs", and thus avoid embedding a random value in
  the tox documentation for --help. This caused documentation builds to fail to
  build reproducibly. (:issue:`2942`)

Bugfixes - 4.7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Update a regular expression in tests to match the exception message in both Python 3.12 and older. (:issue:`3065`)

Improved Documentation - 4.7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix broken links - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`3072`)


v4.6.4 (2023-07-06)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.6.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix hang and zombie process on interrupt (CTRL-C). (:issue:`3056`)

-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.6.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Ensure that ``get_requires_for_build_wheel`` is called before ``prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel``, and
  ``get_requires_for_build_editable`` is called before ``prepare_metadata_for_build_editable`` - by :user:`abravalheri`. (:issue:`3043`)

Improved Documentation - 4.6.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Linked environment variable substitutions docs in
  ``set_env`` and ``pass_env`` config docs. (:issue:`3039`)


v4.6.2 (2023-06-16)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.6.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Avoid cache collision between editable wheel build and normal wheel build -- by :user:`f3flight`. (:issue:`3035`)


v4.6.1 (2023-06-15)
-------------------

No significant changes.


v4.6.0 (2023-06-05)
-------------------

Features - 4.6.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added ``--list-dependencies`` and ``--no-list-dependencies`` CLI parameters.
  If unspecified, defaults to listing when in CI, but not otherwise. (:issue:`3024`)

Misc - 4.6.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- :issue:`3020`


v4.5.1 (2023-05-25)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.5.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix ``tox --devenv venv`` invocation without ``-e`` - by :user:`asottile`. (:issue:`2925`)


v4.5.0 (2023-04-24)
-------------------

Features - 4.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When run with verbosity=1, the per-step timing summaries are suppressed at the
  end of the run.  Thanks to :user:`nedbat` at the PyCon 2023 sprints. (:issue:`2891`)

Improved Documentation - 4.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add FAQ entry on how to test EOL Python versions by :user:`jugmac00`. (:issue:`2989`)


v4.4.12 (2023-04-13)
--------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Avoid race conditions in tests using the ``demo_pkg_inline`` fixture. (:issue:`2985`)


v4.4.11 (2023-04-05)
--------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed an issue where a tox plugin couldn't change the value of ``tox_root``. (:issue:`2966`)


v4.4.10 (2023-04-05)
--------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix issue where ``work_dir`` was not correctly including ``tox_root`` for test runs. (:issue:`2933`)


v4.4.9 (2023-04-05)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Instead of raising ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when command output includes non-utf-8 bytes,
  ``tox`` will now use ``surrogateescape`` error handling to convert the unrecognized bytes
  to escape sequences according to :pep:`383` - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2969`)

Improved Documentation - 4.4.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Document running tox within a Docker container. (:issue:`1035`)
- Added python version 3.11 to ``installation.rst``. (:issue:`2964`)


v4.4.8 (2023-03-26)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``tox.ini`` is now included in source distributions in order to make all tests pass. (:issue:`2939`)
- Fix ``--index-url`` and ``--find-links`` being used together in ``requirements.txt`` files. (:issue:`2959`)


v4.4.6 (2023-02-21)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Plugins are now able to access tox.ini config sections using a custom prefix with the same suffix / name as a tox
  ``testenv`` - by :user:`masenf` (:issue:`2926`)


v4.4.5 (2023-02-07)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Ignore labels when tox will provision a runtime environment (``.tox``) so that environment configurations which depend
  on provisioned plugins or specific tox versions are not accessed in the outer tox process where the configuration would
  be invalid - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2916`)


v4.4.4 (2023-01-31)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Forward ``HOME`` by default - by :user:`gschaffner`. (:issue:`2702`)


v4.4.3 (2023-01-30)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Tox will now expand self-referential extras discovered in package deps to respect local modifications to package
  metadata. This allows a package extra to explicitly depend on another package extra, which previously only worked with
  non-static metadata - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2904`)


v4.4.2 (2023-01-25)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Allow the user configuration file (default ``<appdir>/tox/config.ini``) to be overridden via the
  ``TOX_USER_CONFIG_FILE`` environment variable. Previously tox was looking at the ``TOX_CONFIG_FILE`` to override the
  user configuration, however that environment variable is already used to override the main configuration - by
  :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2890`)


v4.4.1 (2023-01-25)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.4.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- In tox 4.4.0 ``constrain_package_deps`` was introduced with a default value of ``True``. This has been changed back to
  ``False``, which restores the original behavior of tox 4.3.5 - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2897`)


v4.4.0 (2023-01-25)
-------------------

Features - 4.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Test environments now recognize boolean config keys ``constrain_package_deps`` (default=true) and ``use_frozen_constraints`` (default=false),
  which control how tox generates and applies constraints files when performing ``install_package_deps``.

  If ``constrain_package_deps`` is true (default), then tox will write out ``{env_dir}{/}constraints.txt`` and pass it to
  ``pip`` during ``install_package_deps``. If ``use_frozen_constraints`` is false (default), the constraints will be taken
  from the specifications listed under ``deps`` (and inside any requirements or constraints file referenced in ``deps``).
  Otherwise, ``list_dependencies_command`` (``pip freeze``) is used to enumerate exact package specifications which will
  be written to the constraints file.

  In previous releases, conflicting package dependencies would silently override the ``deps`` named in the configuration,
  resulting in test runs against unexpected dependency versions, particularly when using tox factors to explicitly test
  with different versions of dependencies - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2386`)

Bugfixes - 4.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When parsing command lines, use ``shlex(..., posix=True)``, even on windows platforms, since non-POSIX mode does not
  handle escape characters and quoting like a shell would. This improves cross-platform configurations without hacks or
  esoteric quoting.

  To make this transition easier, on Windows, the backslash path separator will not treated as an escape character unless
  it precedes a quote, whitespace, or another backslash character. This allows paths to mostly be written in single or
  double backslash style.

  Note that **double-backslash will no longer be escaped to a single backslash in substitutions**, instead the double
  backslash will be consumed as part of command splitting, on either posix or windows platforms.

  In some instances superfluous double or single quote characters may be stripped from arg arrays in ways that do not
  occur in the default windows ``cmd.exe`` shell - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2635`)

Improved Documentation - 4.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add information when command from ``list_dependencies_command`` configuration option is used. (:issue:`2883`)


v4.3.5 (2023-01-18)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.3.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When building a ``wheel`` or ``editable`` package with a PEP 517 backend, no
  longer pass an empty ``metadata_directory`` to the backend ``build_wheel`` or
  ``build_editable`` endpoint.

  Some backends, such as PDM and poetry, will not generate package metadata in
  the presence of a ``metadata_directory``, even if it is empty.

  Prior to this change, attempting to install a wheel created by tox using PDM or
  poetry would return an error like "There is no item named
  'my-package.0.1.dist-info/WHEEL' in the archive" - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2880`)


v4.3.4 (2023-01-17)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.3.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When executing via the provisioning environment (``.tox`` by default), run
  ``tox`` in working directory of the parent process.

  Prior to this change (from tox 4.0.0), the provisioned ``tox`` would execute with
  ``{tox_root}`` as the working directory, which breaks when a relative path is
  passed to ``-c`` or ``--conf`` and ``tox`` is executed in a working directory
  other than ``{tox_root}`` - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2876`)

Misc - 4.3.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- :issue:`2878`


v4.3.3 (2023-01-16)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.3.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The provision environment (``.tox``) will never inherit from ``testenv``.
  During provisioning, other test environments are not processed, allowing the
  use of keys and values that may be registered by later tox version or
  provisioned plugins - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2862`)


v4.3.2 (2023-01-16)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix regression introduced in 4.3.0 which occurred when a substitution expression
  for an environment variable that had previously been substituted appears in the
  ini file after a substitution expression for a different environment variable.
  This situation erroneously resulted in an exception about "circular chain
  between set" of those variables - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2869`)


v4.3.1 (2023-01-15)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix regression introduced in 4.3.0 by expanding substitution expressions
  (``{...}``) that result from a previous subsitution's replacement value (up to
  100 times). Note that recursive expansion is strictly depth-first; no
  replacement value will ever affect adjacent characters nor will expansion ever
  occur over the result of more than one replacement - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2863`)


v4.3.0 (2023-01-15)
-------------------

Features - 4.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Rewrite substitution replacement parser - by :user:`masenf`

  * ``\`` acts as a proper escape for ``\`` in ini-style substitutions
  * The resulting value of a substitution is no longer reprocessed in the context
    of the broader string. (Prior to this change, ini-values were repeatedly re-substituted until
    the expression no longer had modifications)
  * Migrate and update "Substitutions" section of Configuration page from v3 docs.
  * ``find_replace_part`` is removed from ``tox.config.loader.ini.replace``
  * New names exported from ``tox.config.loader.ini.replace``:
      * ``find_replace_expr``
      * ``MatchArg``
      * ``MatchError``
      * ``MatchExpression``
      * Note: the API for ``replace`` itself is unchanged. (:issue:`2732`)
- Improved documentation for factors and test env names - by :user:`stephenfin`. (:issue:`2852`)


v4.2.8 (2023-01-11)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.2.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Allow using package names with env markers for pip's ``--no-binary`` and ``--only-binary`` options - by :user:`q0w`. (:issue:`2814`)


v4.2.7 (2023-01-11)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.2.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A testenv with multiple factors, one of which conflicts with a ``base_python`` setting in ``tox.ini``, will now use the
  correct Python interpreter version - by :user:`stephenfin`. (:issue:`2838`)
- Explicitly list ``wheel`` as requirement for the tests, as some of the tests error without it. (:issue:`2843`)
- tox has reverted support for Python factors that include PATCH release info (e.g. ``py3.10.1``), build architecture
  (e.g. ``pypy3-64``) or do not define a ``py`` prefix or other supported prefix (e.g. ``3.10``). These complex factors
  were initially supported with the release of tox 4.0 but has proven complicated to support. Instead, the simple factors
  supported by tox 3 e.g. (``py310``, ``pypy3``) or period-separated equivalent (``py3.10``) introduced in tox 4 should be
  used. Users who wish to specify more specific Python version information should configure the :ref:`base_python` setting
  - by :user:`stephenfin`. (:issue:`2848`)


v4.2.6 (2023-01-06)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Handle properly pip ``--no-binary`` / ``--only-binary`` options in requirements.txt format files. (:issue:`2814`)


v4.2.5 (2023-01-06)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.2.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The combination of ``usedevelop = true`` and ``--skip-missing-interpreters=false`` will no longer fail for environments
  that were *not* invoked - by :user:`stephenfin`. (:issue:`2811`)
- Fix an attribute error when ``use_develop = true`` is set and an unsupported interpreter version is requested - by
  :user:`stephenfin`. (:issue:`2826`)
- tox returns a non-zero error code if all envs are skipped. It will now correctly do this if only a single env was
  requested and this was skipped - by :user:`stephenfin`. (:issue:`2827`)


v4.2.4 (2023-01-05)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Setting ``[testenv] basepython = python3`` will no longer override the Python interpreter version requested by a factor,
  such as ``py311`` - by :user:`stephenfin`. (:issue:`2754`)
- Also accept tab after colon before factor filter expansion - by :user:`pdecat`. (:issue:`2823`)


v4.2.3 (2023-01-04)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``devenv`` does not respect the specified path when the package is a wheel file - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`2815`)
- Require space after colon before factor filter expansion, unless it is the last character of the line - by :user:`pdecat`. (:issue:`2822`)


v4.2.2 (2023-01-04)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add ``CC``, ``CFLAGS``, ``CCSHARED``, ``CXX``, ``CPPFLAGS``, ``LDFLAGS``, ``PKG_CONFIG`` and ``PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR``
  to the default passed through environment variables list as these are needed for building various C-extensions
  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`2818`)


v4.2.1 (2023-01-03)
-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix extracting extras from markers with more than 2 extras in an or chain - by :user:`dconathan`. (:issue:`2791`)


v4.2.0 (2023-01-03)
-------------------

Features - 4.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Packaging environments now inherit from the ``pkgenv`` section, allowing to set all your packaging options in one place,
  and support the ``deps`` key to set additional dependencies that will be installed after ``pyproject.toml`` static
  ``requires`` but before backends dynamic requires - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`2543`)

Improved Documentation - 4.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Document breaking changes with tox 4 and packaging environments - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`2543`)
- Document how to handle environments whose names match ``tox`` subcommands - by :user:`sirosen`. (:issue:`2728`)

-------------------

Bugfixes - 4.1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Reuse package_env with ``--installpkg`` - by :user:`q0w`. (:issue:`2442`)

- Restore tox 3 behavior of showing the output of pip freeze, however now only active when running inside a CI
  environment - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`2685`)
- Fix extracting extras from markers with many extras - by :user:`q0w`. (:issue:`2791`)

  argument to locate the ``tox.ini`` file - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`2619`)


v4.0.15 (2022-12-19)
--------------------

Bugfixes - 4.0.15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix tox auto-provisioning not working and relax :ref:`min_version` default from ``4.0`` to no version constraint

v4.0.14 (2022-12-18)
--------------------

Bugfixes - 4.0.14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Do not include non test environment sections or factor filters in INI configuration to factor discovery - by
  :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`2746`)


v4.0.13 (2022-12-17)
--------------------

Bugfixes - 4.0.13

- Fix python hash seed not being set - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`2645`)
- Fix legacy CLI flags ``--pre``, ``--force-deps``, ``--sitepackages`` and ``--alwayscopy`` not working, and mark them

Improved Documentation - 4.0.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Document user level config. (:issue:`2633`)


v4.0.11 (2022-12-14)
--------------------

Features - 4.0.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Modified handling of ``NO_COLOR`` environment variable, consistent with
  `de facto conventions <https://no-color.org>`_: any non-empty string will enable ``NO_COLOR`` (disable colorized
  output); no ``NO_COLOR`` variable or ``NO_COLOR`` with an empty string will disable ``NO_COLOR`` (enable colorized
  output) - by :user:`ptmcg`. (:issue:`2719`)

Bugfixes - 4.0.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for the ``platform`` settings in tox test environments - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1845`)
- Add support for the ``recreate`` settings in tox test environments - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1846`)
- Allow Python test and packaging environments with version 2.7 - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1900`)
- Do not construct a requirements file for deps in virtualenv, instead pass content as CLI argument to pip - by
  :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1906`)
- Do not display status update environment reports when interrupted or for the final environment ran (because at the
  final report will be soon printed and makes the status update redundant) - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1909`)
- The ``_TOX_SHOW_THREAD`` environment variable can be used to print alive threads when tox exists (useful to debug
  when tox hangs because of some non-finished thread) and also now prints the pid of the local subprocess when reporting
  the outcome of an execution - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1915`)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Normalize description text to collapse newlines and one or more than whitespace to a single space - by
  :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1829`)
- Support aliases in show config key specification (will print with the primary key) - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1831`)
- Show config no longer marks as unused keys that are inherited (e.g. if the key is coming from ``testenv`` section and our
  target is ``testenv:fix``) - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1833`)
- ``--alwayscopy`` and ``--sitepackages`` legacy only flags do not work - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1839`)
- Fix handling of ``commands_pre``/``commands``/``commands_post`` to be in line with tox 3 (returned incorrect exit codes
  and post was not always executed) - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1843`)
- Support requirement files containing ``--hash`` constraints - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1903`)
- Fix a bug that caused tox to never finish when pulling configuration from a tox run environment that was never executed
  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1915`)

Deprecations and Removals - 4.0.0a6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- - Drop support for ``sdistsrc`` flag because introduces a significant complexity and is barely used (5 hits on a github
    search).
  - ``--skip-missing-interpreters``, ``--notest``, ``--sdistonly``, ``--installpkg``, ``--develop`` and
    ``--skip-pkg-install`` CLI flags are no longer available for ``devenv`` (enforce the only sane value for these).

  By :user:`gaborbernat` (:issue:`1839`)
- Remove Jenkins override support: this feature goes against the spirit of tox - blurring the line between the CI and
  local runs. It also singles out a single CI provider, which opens the door for other CIs wanting similar functionality.
  Finally, only 54 code file examples came back on a Github search, showing this is a not widely used feature. People who
  still want Jenkins override support may create a tox plugin to achieve this functionality - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1841`)


v4.0.0a5 (2021-01-23)
---------------------

Features - 4.0.0a5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Support the ``system_site_packages``/``sitepackages`` flag for virtual environment based tox environments -
  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1847`)
- Support the ``always_copy``/``alwayscopy`` flag for virtual environment based tox environments -
  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1848`)
- Support the ``download`` flag for virtual environment based tox environments - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1849`)
- Recreate virtual environment based tox environments when the ``virtualenv`` version changes - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1865`)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Not all package dependencies are installed when different tox environments in the same run use different set of
  extras - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1868`)
- Support ``=`` separator in requirement file flags, directories as requirements and correctly set the root of the
  requirements file when using the ``--root`` CLI flag to change the root - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1853`)
- Cleanup local subprocess file handlers when exiting runs (fixes ``ResourceWarning: unclosed file`` errors when running
  with ``env PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=5 PYTHONDEVMODE=y`` under a Python built with ``--with-pydebug``)
  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1857`)
- Various small bugfixes:

  - honor updating default environment variables set by internal tox via set env (``PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK``)
  - do not multi-wrap ``HandledError`` in the ini file loader,
  - skipped environments are logged now with their fail message at default verbosity level,
  - fix an error that made the show configuration command crash when making the string of a config value failed,
  - support empty-new lines within the set env configurations replacements,

  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1864`)

Improved Documentation - 4.0.0a5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v4.0.0a4 (2021-01-16)
---------------------

Features - 4.0.0a4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use ``.tox/4`` instead of ``.tox4`` folder (so ignores for tox 3 works for tox 4 too), reminder we'll rename this to
  just ``.tox`` before public release, however to encourage testing tox 4 in parallel with tox 3 this is helpful
  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:discussion:`1812`)
- Colorize the ``config`` command: section headers are yellow, keys are green, values remained white, exceptions are light
  red and comments are cyan - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1821`)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Support legacy format (``-cconstraint.txt``) of constraint files in ``deps``, and expand constraint files too when
  viewing inside the ``deps`` or calculating weather our environment is up to date or not - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1788`)
- When specifying requirements/editable/constraint paths within ``deps`` escape space, unless already escaped to support
  running specifying transitive requirements files within deps - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1792`)
- When using a provisioned tox environment requesting ``--recreate`` failed with ``AttributeError`` -
  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1793`)
- Fix ``RequirementsFile`` from tox is rendered incorrectly in ``config`` command - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1820`)
- Fix a bug in the configuration system where referring to the same named key in another env/section causes circular
  dependency error - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1821`)
- Raise ``ValueError`` with descriptive message when a requirements file specified does not exist
  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1828`)
- Support all valid requirement file specification without delimiting space in the ``deps`` of the ``tox.ini`` -
  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1834`)

Improved Documentation - 4.0.0a4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add code style guide for contributors - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1734`)


v4.0.0a3 (2021-01-13)
---------------------

Features - 4.0.0a3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Raise exception when set env enters into a circular reference - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1779`)
- - Raise exception when variable substitution enters into a circle.
  - Add ``{/}`` as substitution for os specific path separator.
  - Add ``{env_bin_dir}`` constant substitution.
  - Implement support for ``--discover`` flag - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1784`)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Entries in the ``set_env`` does not reference environments from ``set_env`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1776`)
- ``env`` substitution does not uses values from ``set_env`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1779`)
- Adopt tox 3 base pass env list, by adding:

  - on all platforms: ``LANG``, ``LANGUAGE``, ``CURL_CA_BUNDLE``, ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` , ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNLDE``,
  - on Windows: ``SYSTEMDRIVE`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1780`)
- Fixed a bug that crashed tox where calling tox with the recreate flag and when multiple environments were reusing the
  same package - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1782`)
- - Python version markers are stripped in package dependencies (after wrongfully being detected as an extra marker).
  - In packaging APIs do not set ``PYTHONPATH`` (to empty string) if ``backend-path`` is empty.
  - Fix commands parsing on Windows (do not auto-escape ``\`` - instead users should use the new ``{\}``, and on parsed
    arguments strip both ``'`` and ``"`` quoted outcomes).
  - Allow windows paths in substitution set/default (the ``:`` character used to separate substitution arguments may
    also be present in paths on Windows - do not support single capital letter values as substitution arguments) -
    by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1784`)
- Rework how we handle Python packaging environments:

  - the base packaging environment changed from ``.package`` to ``.pkg``,
  - merged the ``sdist``, ``wheel`` and ``dev`` separate packaging implementations into one, and internally dynamically
    pick the one that's needed,
  - the base packaging environment always uses the same Python environment as tox is installed into,
  - the base packaging environment is used to get the metadata of the project (via PEP-517) and to build ``sdist`` and
    ``dev`` packages,
  - for building wheels introduced a new per env configurable option ``wheel_build_env``, if the target Python major/minor
    and implementation for the run tox environment and the base package tox environment matches set this to ``.pkg``,
    otherwise this is ``.pkg-{implementation}{major}{minor}``,
  - internally now packaging environments can create further packaging environments they are responsible of managing,
  - updated ``depends`` to use the packaging logic,
  - add support skip missing interpreters for depends and show config,

  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:issue:`1804`)


v4.0.0a2 (2021-01-09)
---------------------

  :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1630`)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix coverage generation in CI - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1551`)
- Fix the CI failures:

  - drop Python 3.5 support as it's not expected to get to a release before EOL,
  - fix test using ``\n`` instead of ``os.linesep``,
  - Windows Python 3.6 does not contain ``_overlapped.ReadFileInto``

  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1556`)

Improved Documentation - 4.0.0a2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add base documentation by merging virtualenv structure with tox 3 - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (:pull:`1551`)


v4.0.0a1
--------
* First version all is brand new.

.. warning::

   The current tox is the second iteration of implementation. From version ``0.5`` all the way to ``3.X``
   we numbered the first iteration. Version ``4.0.0a1`` is a complete rewrite of the package, and as such this release
   history starts from there. The old changelog is still available in the
   `legacy branch documentation <https://tox.wiki/en/legacy/changelog.html>`_.
