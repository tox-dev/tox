tox - automation project
========================

``tox`` aims to automate and standardize testing in Python. It is part of a larger vision of easing the packaging,
testing and release process of Python software (alongside `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_
and `devpi <https://devpi.net/>`_).

tox is a generic virtual environment management and test command line tool you can use for:

* checking your package builds and installs correctly under different environments (such as different Python
  implementations, versions or installation dependencies),
* running your tests in each of the environments with the test tool of choice,
* acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and
  shell-based testing.

**Related projects**

tox has influenced several other projects in the Python test automation space. If tox doesn't quite fit your needs or
you want to do more research, we recommend taking a look at these projects:

- `Invoke <https://www.pyinvoke.org/>`_ is a general-purpose task execution library, similar to Make. Invoke is far more
  general-purpose than tox but it does not contain the Python testing-specific features that tox specializes in.

- `Nox <https://nox.thea.codes>`_  is a project similar in spirit to tox but different in approach. Nox's key
  difference is that it uses Python scripts instead of a configuration file. Nox might be useful if you find tox's
  configuration too limiting but aren't looking to move to something as general-purpose as Invoke or Make.
