Add ``{env_site_packages_dir_plat}`` / ``{envsitepackagesdir_plat}`` substitution that returns the platform-specific
(platlib) site-packages directory. On some Linux distributions (Fedora, RHEL) this resolves to ``lib64`` instead of
``lib``, which is no longer symlinked since virtualenv 20.x - by :user:`gaborbernat`.
