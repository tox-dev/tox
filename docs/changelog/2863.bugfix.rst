Fix regression introduced in 4.3.0 by expanding substitution expressions
(``{...}``) that result from a previous subsitution's replacement value (up to
100 times). Note that recursive expansion is strictly depth-first; no
replacement value will ever affect adjacent characters nor will expansion ever
occur over the result of more than one replacement - by :user:`masenf`.
