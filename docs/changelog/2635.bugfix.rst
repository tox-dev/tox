When parsing command lines, use ``shlex(..., posix=True)``, even on windows platforms, since non-POSIX mode does not
handle escape characters and quoting like a shell would. This improves cross-platform configurations without hacks or
esoteric quoting.

To make this transition easier, on Windows, the backslash path separator will not treated as an escape character unless
it preceeds a quote, whitespace, or another backslash chracter. This allows paths to mostly be written in single or
double backslash style.

Note that **double-backslash will no longer be escaped to a single backslash in substitutions**, instead the double
backslash will be consumed as part of command splitting, on either posix or windows platforms.

In some instances superfluous double or single quote characters may be stripped from arg arrays in ways that do not
occur in the default windows ``cmd.exe`` shell - by :user:`masenf`.
