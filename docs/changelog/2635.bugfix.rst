When parsing command lines, use ``shlex(..., posix=True)``, even on windows
platforms, since non-POSIX mode does not handle escape characters and quoting
like a shell would. This improves cross-platform configurations without hacks
or esoteric quoting.

To make this transition easier, on windows, the backslash path separator will
not treated as an escape character unless it preceeds a quote, whitespace, or
another backslash chracter. This allows paths to mostly be written in single or
double backslash style.

In some instances superfluous double or single quote characters may be stripped
from arg arrays in ways that do not occur in the default windows ``cmd.exe``
shell.
