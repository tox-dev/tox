Support PEP 751 ``pylock.toml`` lock files as dependency input via the ``pylock`` configuration option (mutually
exclusive with ``deps``). Packages are filtered by extras, dependency groups, and platform markers evaluated against the
target Python interpreter, then installed via pip with ``--no-deps`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`.
