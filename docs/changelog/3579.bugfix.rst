Follow `FORCE_COLOR <https://force-color.org/>`_ recommendations: any non-empty value now enables color
(previously only ``yes``, ``true``, or ``1`` were accepted, and other values caused a crash).
Also add support for `TTY_COMPATIBLE`_
(``1`` forces color, ``0`` disables it) — by :user:`rahuldevikar`.
