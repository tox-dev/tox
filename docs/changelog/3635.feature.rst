Add ``--no-capture`` (``-i``) CLI flag to disable output capture, allowing interactive programs like Python REPL to
access the terminal directly. When enabled, subprocess inherits parent console handles instead of pipes, fixing issues
where terminal APIs (e.g., querying console dimensions) fail on pipe handles. Mutually exclusive with ``--result-json``
and parallel mode - by :user:`gaborjbernat`. Fixes :issue:`3635`.
