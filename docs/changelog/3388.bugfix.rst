Multiple fixes for the TOML configuration by :user:`gaborbernat`.:

- Do not fail when there is an empty command within ``commands``.
- Allow references for ``set_env`` by accepting list of dictionaries for it.
- Do not try to be smart about reference unrolling, instead allow the user to control it via the ``extend`` flag,
  available both for ``posargs`` and ``ref`` replacements.
- The ``ref`` replacements ``raw`` key has been renamed to ``of``.
