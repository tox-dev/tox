When ``set_env`` both inherits via cross-section substitution (e.g., ``{[testenv]set_env}``) and explicitly overrides
the same variable, the explicit value was incorrectly replaced by the inherited one because ``load()`` moved the key
from the raw dict to the materialized dict before the deferred substitution ran, making the protection check ineffective
- by :user:`gaborjbernat`. Fixes :issue:`3773`.
