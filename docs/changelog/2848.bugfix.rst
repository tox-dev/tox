tox has reverted support for Python factors that include PATCH release info (e.g. ``py3.10.1``), build architecture
(e.g. ``pypy3-64``) or do not define a ``py`` prefix or other supported prefix (e.g. ``3.10``). These complex factors
were initially supported with the release of tox 4.0 but has proven complicated to support. Instead, the simple factors
supported by tox 3 e.g. (``py310``, ``pypy3``) or period-separated equivalent (``py3.10``) introduced in tox 4 should be
used. Users who wish to specify more specific Python version information should configure the :ref:`base_python` setting
- by :user:`stephenfin`.
