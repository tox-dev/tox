A new tox life cycle event is now exposed for use via :doc:`Plugins
API </plugins>` -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

The corresponding hook point is :func:`tox_extend_envs
<tox.plugin.spec.tox_extend_envs>`. It allows plugin authors to
declare ephemeral environments that they can then populate through
the in-memory configuration loader interface.

This patch was made possible thanks to pair programming with
:user:`gaborbernat` at PyCon US 2025.
