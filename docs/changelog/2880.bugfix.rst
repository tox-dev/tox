When building a ``wheel`` or ``editable`` package with a PEP 517 backend, no
longer pass an empty ``metadata_directory`` to the backend ``build_wheel`` or
``build_editable`` endpoint.

Some backends, such as PDM and poetry, will not generate package metadata in
the presence of a ``metadata_directory``, even if it is empty.

Prior to this change, attempting to install a wheel created by tox using PDM or
poetry would return an error like "There is no item named
'my-package.0.1.dist-info/WHEEL' in the archive" - by :user:`masenf`.
