Rewrite substitution replacement parser - by :user:`masenf`

* ``\`` acts as a proper escape for ``\`` in ini-style substitutions
* The resulting value of a substitution is no longer reprocessed in the context
  of the broader string. (Prior to this change, ini-values were repeatedly re-substituted until
  the expression no longer had modifications)
* Migrate and update "Substitutions" section of Configuration page from v3 docs.
* ```find_replace_part`` is removed from ``tox.config.loader.ini.replace``
* New names exported from ``tox.config.loader.ini.replace``:
    * ``find_replace_expr``
    * ``MatchArg``
    * ``MatchError``
    * ``MatchExpression``
    * Note: the API for ``replace`` itself is unchanged.
