Expose the configuration loading mechanism to plugins to define and load their own sections. Add
:meth:`tox_add_env_config <tox.plugin.spec.tox_add_env_config>` plugin hook called after the configuration environment
is created for a tox environment and removed ``tox_configure``. Add the main configuration object as argument to
:meth:`tox_add_core_config <tox.plugin.spec.tox_add_core_config>`. Move the environment list method from the state to
the main configuration object to allow its use within plugins -- by :user:`gaborbernat`.
