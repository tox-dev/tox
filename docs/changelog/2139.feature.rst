When cleaning directories (for tox environment, ``env_log_dir``, ``env_tmp_dir`` and packaging metadata folders) do not
delete the directory itself and recreate, but instead just delete its content (this allows the user to cd into it and
still be in a valid folder after a new run) - by :user:`gaborbernat`.
