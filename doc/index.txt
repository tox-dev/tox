Welcome to the tox automation project 
===============================================

.. note::

    tox is alpha software and may have crucial platform-specific 
    or environment specific bugs. Use with care. 

vision: merge testing and deployment 
----------------------------------------

``tox`` aims to automate state-of-the-art packaging, testing and
deployment of Python software right from your console *or* CI
server, invoking your tools of choice.

What is Tox? 
--------------------

Tox as is a generic virtualenv_ management and test command line tool you can use for:

* checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and 
  interpreters 

* running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice 

* acting as a frontend to Continous Integration servers, greatly
  reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing. 

Basic example
-----------------

First, install ``tox`` with ``pip install tox`` or ``easy_install tox``. 
Then put basic information about your project and the test environments you
want your project to run in into a ``tox.ini`` file residing 
right next to your ``setup.py`` file::

    # content of: tox.ini , put in same dir as setup.py 
    [tox]
    envlist = py26,py27
    [testenv]
    commands=py.test  # or 'nosetests' or ...

To sdist-package, install and test your project against Python2.6 and Python2.7, just type::

    tox 

and watch things happening (you must have python2.6 and python2.7 installed in your 
environment otherwise you will see errors).  When you run ``tox`` a second time
you'll note that it runs much faster because it keeps track of virtualenv details
and will not recreate or re-install dependencies.  You also might want to 
checkout :doc:`examples` to get some more ideas. 

Current features 
-------------------

* **automation of tedious Python related test activities**

* **test your Python package against many interpreter and dependency configs**

    - automatic customizable (re)creation of virtualenv_ test environments 

    - installs your ``setup.py`` based project into each virtual environment

    - test-tool agnostic: runs py.test, nose or unittests a uniform manner

* uses pip_ (for Python2 environments) and distribute_ (for all environments) by default 

* **cross-Python compatible**: Python2.4 up to Python2.7, Jython and experimental
  Python3 support as well as for pypy-c (which needs patches) 

* **cross-platform**: Windows and Unix style environments 

* **integrates with continous integration servers** like Hudson_ and helps
  you to avoid boilerplatish and platform-specific build-step hacks. 

* **unified automatic artifact management** between ``tox`` runs both 
  in a local developer shell as well as in a CI/Hudson context. 

* **driven by a simple ini-style config file**

* **documented** :doc:`examples <examples>` and :doc:`configuration <config>` 

* **concise reporting** about tool invocations and configuration errors

* **professionally** :doc:`supported <support>`

Notes and known limitations 
----------------------------------

* ``tox`` always operates in virtualenv_ environments, it cannot work with 
  globally installed Python interpreters because there are no reliable means
  to install and recreate dependencies.  Or does it still makes sense to 
  allow using global Python installations? 

* ``tox`` is fresh on the Python testing scene (first release July 2010) and 
  needs some battle testing and feedback.  It is is likely to evolve in 
  (possibly incompatible) increments as it provides more power to configure 
  and customize the test process. 

* ``tox`` uses virtualenv_ and virtualenv3_, the latter being a fork
  which roughly works with Python3 but has less features (no "pip" and
  other problems).  solution: virtualenv_ needs to merge and grow proper 
  native Python3 support, preferably in a "single-source" way. 

* tox does not work on the Windows/Python3/Virtualenv3 combination
  because there is no setuptools_ for Python3 and virtualenv3_ does 
  not support using distribute_. 

* ``tox`` currently uses a ``setup.py sdist`` invocation to create 
  an installable package and then invokes ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` to 
  install into each test environment.  There is no support for other
  installation methods.
