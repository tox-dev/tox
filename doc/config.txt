tox configuration specification
===============================

.. _ConfigParser: http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html

``tox.ini`` files uses the standard ConfigParser_ "ini-style" format.
Below you find the specification, but you might want to skim some
:doc:`examples` first and use this page as a reference.

Tox global settings
-------------------

List of optional global options::

    [tox]
    minversion=ver    # minimally required tox version
    toxworkdir=path   # tox working directory, defaults to {toxinidir}/.tox
    setupdir=path     # defaults to {toxinidir}
    distdir=path      # defaults to {toxworkdir}/dist
    distshare=path    # (DEPRECATED) defaults to {homedir}/.tox/distshare
    envlist=ENVLIST   # defaults to the list of all environments
    skipsdist=BOOL    # defaults to false


``tox`` autodetects if it is running in a Jenkins_ context
(by checking for existence of the ``JENKINS_URL`` environment variable)
and will first lookup global tox settings in this section::

    [tox:jenkins]
    ...               # override [tox] settings for the jenkins context
    # note: for jenkins distshare defaults to ``{toxworkdir}/distshare`` (DEPRECATED)

.. confval:: skip_missing_interpreters=BOOL

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.2

    Setting this to ``True`` is equivalent of passing the
    ``--skip-missing-interpreters`` command line option, and will force ``tox`` to
    return success even if some of the specified environments were missing. This is
    useful for some CI systems or running on a developer box, where you might only
    have a subset of all your supported interpreters installed but don't want to
    mark the build as failed because of it. As expected, the command line switch
    always overrides this setting if passed on the invokation.
    **Default:** ``False``

.. confval:: envlist=CSV

    Determining the environment list that ``tox`` is to operate on
    happens in this order (if any is found, no further lookups are made):

    * command line option ``-eENVLIST``
    * environment variable ``TOXENV``
    * ``tox.ini`` file's ``envlist``


Virtualenv test environment settings
------------------------------------

Test environments are defined by a::

    [testenv:NAME]
    ...

section.  The ``NAME`` will be the name of the virtual environment.
Defaults for each setting in this section are looked up in the::

    [testenv]
    ...

testenvironment default section.

Complete list of settings that you can put into ``testenv*`` sections:

.. confval:: basepython=NAME-OR-PATH

    name or path to a Python interpreter which will be used for creating
    the virtual environment. **default**: interpreter used for tox invocation.

.. confval:: commands=ARGVLIST

    the commands to be called for testing. Each command is defined
    by one or more lines; a command can have multiple lines if a line
    ends with the ``\`` character in which case the subsequent line
    will be appended (and may contain another ``\`` character ...).
    For eventually performing a call to ``subprocess.Popen(args, ...)``
    ``args`` are determined by splitting the whole command by whitespace.
    Similar to ``make`` recipe lines, any command with a leading ``-``
    will ignore the exit code.

.. confval:: install_command=ARGV

    .. versionadded:: 1.6

    the ``install_command`` setting is used for installing packages into
    the virtual environment; both the package under test
    and any defined dependencies. Must contain the substitution key
    ``{packages}`` which will be replaced by the packages to
    install.  You should also accept ``{opts}`` if you are using
    pip or easy_install -- it will contain index server options
    if you have configured them via :confval:`indexserver`
    and the deprecated :confval:`downloadcache` option
    if you have configured it.

    **default**::

        pip install {opts} {packages}


.. confval:: list_dependencies_command

    .. versionadded:: 2.4

    the ``list_dependencies_command`` setting is used for listing
    the packages installed into the virtual environment.

    **default**::

        pip freeze


.. confval:: ignore_errors=True|False(default)

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

      If ``True``, a non-zero exit code from one command will be ignored and
      further commands will be executed (which was the default behavior in tox <
      2.0).  If ``False`` (the default), then a non-zero exit code from one command
      will abort execution of commands for that environment.

      It may be helpful to note that this setting is analogous to the ``-i`` or
      ``ignore-errors`` option of GNU Make. A similar name was chosen to reflect the
      similarity in function.

      Note that in tox 2.0, the default behavior of tox with respect to
      treating errors from commands changed. Tox < 2.0 would ignore errors by
      default. Tox >= 2.0 will abort on an error by default, which is safer and more
      typical of CI and command execution tools, as it doesn't make sense to
      run tests if installing some prerequisite failed and it doesn't make sense to
      try to deploy if tests failed.

.. confval:: pip_pre=True|False(default)

    .. versionadded:: 1.9

    If ``True``, adds ``--pre`` to the ``opts`` passed to
    :confval:`install_command`. If :confval:`install_command` uses pip, this
    will cause it to install the latest available pre-release of any
    dependencies without a specified version. If ``False`` (the default), pip
    will only install final releases of unpinned dependencies.

    Passing the ``--pre`` command-line option to tox will force this to
    ``True`` for all testenvs.

    Don't set this option if your :confval:`install_command` does not use pip.

.. confval:: whitelist_externals=MULTI-LINE-LIST

    each line specifies a command name (in glob-style pattern format)
    which can be used in the ``commands`` section without triggering
    a "not installed in virtualenv" warning.  Example: if you use the
    unix ``make`` for running tests you can list ``whitelist_externals=make``
    or ``whitelist_externals=/usr/bin/make`` if you want more precision.
    If you don't want tox to issue a warning in any case, just use
    ``whitelist_externals=*`` which will match all commands (not recommended).

.. confval:: changedir=path

    change to this working directory when executing the test command.
    **default**: ``{toxinidir}``

.. confval:: deps=MULTI-LINE-LIST

    test-specific dependencies - to be installed into the environment prior to project
    package installation.  Each line defines a dependency, which will be
    passed to the installer command for processing.  Each line specifies a file,
    a URL or a package name.  You can additionally specify
    an :confval:`indexserver` to use for installing this dependency
    but this functionality is deprecated since tox-2.3.
    All derived dependencies (deps required by the dep) will then be
    retrieved from the specified indexserver::

        deps = :myindexserver:pkg

    (Experimentally introduced in 1.6.1) all installer commands are executed
    using the ``{toxinidir}`` as the current working directory.

.. confval:: platform=REGEX

    A testenv can define a new ``platform`` setting as a regular expression.
    If a non-empty expression is defined and does not match against the
    ``sys.platform`` string the test environment will be skipped.

.. confval:: setenv=MULTI-LINE-LIST

   .. versionadded:: 0.9

   each line contains a NAME=VALUE environment variable setting which
   will be used for all test command invocations as well as for installing
   the sdist package into a virtual environment.

.. confval:: passenv=SPACE-SEPARATED-GLOBNAMES

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   A list of wildcard environment variable names which
   shall be copied from the tox invocation environment to the test
   environment when executing test commands.  If a specified environment
   variable doesn't exist in the tox invocation environment it is ignored.
   You can use ``*`` and ``?`` to match multiple environment variables with
   one name.

   Note that the ``PATH``, ``LANG`` and ``PIP_INDEX_URL`` variables are
   unconditionally passed down and on Windows ``SYSTEMROOT``, ``PATHEXT``,
   ``TEMP`` and ``TMP`` will be passed down as well whereas on unix
   ``TMPDIR`` will be passed down.  You can override these variables
   with the ``setenv`` option.

   If defined the ``TOX_TESTENV_PASSENV`` environment variable (in the tox
   invocation environment) can define additional space-separated variable
   names that are to be passed down to the test command environment.

.. confval:: recreate=True|False(default)

    Always recreate virtual environment if this option is True.

.. confval:: downloadcache=path

    **DEPRECATED** -- as of August 2013 this option is not very
    useful because of pypi's CDN and because of caching pypi
    server solutions like `devpi <http://doc.devpi.net>`_.

    use this directory for caching downloads.  This value is overriden
    by the environment variable ``PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` if it exists. If
    you specify a custom :confval:`install_command` that uses an
    installer other than pip, your installer must support the
    `--download-cache` command-line option.
    **default**: no download cache will be used.

.. confval:: sitepackages=True|False

    Set to ``True`` if you want to create virtual environments that also
    have access to globally installed packages.

    **default:** False, meaning that virtualenvs will be
    created without inheriting the global site packages.

.. confval:: args_are_paths=BOOL

    treat positional arguments passed to ``tox`` as file system paths
    and - if they exist on the filesystem - rewrite them according
    to the ``changedir``.
    **default**: True (due to the exists-on-filesystem check it's
    usually safe to try rewriting).

.. confval:: envtmpdir=path

    defines a temporary directory for the virtualenv which will be cleared
    each time before the group of test commands is invoked.
    **default**: ``{envdir}/tmp``

.. confval:: envlogdir=path

    defines a directory for logging where tox will put logs of tool
    invocation.
    **default**: ``{envdir}/log``

.. confval:: indexserver

   .. versionadded:: 0.9

   (DEPRECATED, will be removed in a future version) Multi-line ``name =
   URL`` definitions of python package servers.  Dependencies can
   specify using a specified index server through the
   ``:indexservername:depname`` pattern.  The ``default`` indexserver
   definition determines where unscoped dependencies and the sdist install
   installs from.  Example::

        [tox]
        indexserver =
            default = http://mypypi.org

   will make tox install all dependencies from this PYPI index server
   (including when installing the project sdist package).


.. confval:: envdir

   .. versionadded:: 1.5

   User can set specific path for environment. If path would not be absolute it
   would be treated as relative to ``{toxinidir}``. **default**:
   ``{toxworkdir}/{envname}``

.. confval:: usedevelop=BOOL

    .. versionadded:: 1.6

    Install the current package in development mode with "setup.py
    develop" instead of installing from the ``sdist`` package. (This
    uses pip's `-e` option, so should be avoided if you've specified a
    custom :confval:`install_command` that does not support ``-e``).

    **default**: ``False``

.. confval:: skip_install=BOOL

    .. versionadded:: 1.9

    Do not install the current package. This can be used when you need the
    virtualenv management but do not want to install the current package
    into that environment.

    **default**: ``False``

.. confval:: ignore_outcome=BOOL

    .. versionadded:: 2.2

    If set to True a failing result of this testenv will not make tox fail,
    only a warning will be produced.

    **default**: ``False``

.. confval:: extras=MULTI-LINE-LIST

    .. versionadded:: 2.4

    A list of "extras" to be installed with the sdist or develop install.
    For example, ``extras = testing`` is equivalent to ``[testing]`` in a
    ``pip install`` command.


Substitutions
-------------

Any ``key=value`` setting in an ini-file can make use
of value substitution through the ``{...}`` string-substitution pattern.

You can escape curly braces with the ``\`` character if you need them, for example::

    commands = echo "\{posargs\}" = {posargs}

Globally available substitutions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``{toxinidir}``
    the directory where tox.ini is located

``{toxworkdir}``
    the directory where virtual environments are created and sub directories
    for packaging reside.

``{homedir}``
    the user-home directory path.

``{distdir}``
    the directory where sdist-packages will be created in

``{distshare}``
    (DEPRECATED) the directory where sdist-packages will be copied to so that
    they may be accessed by other processes or tox runs.

substitutions for virtualenv-related sections
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``{envname}``
    the name of the virtual environment
``{envpython}``
    path to the virtual Python interpreter
``{envdir}``
    directory of the virtualenv hierarchy
``{envbindir}``
    directory where executables are located
``{envsitepackagesdir}``
    directory where packages are installed.
    Note that architecture-specific files may appear in a different directory.
``{envtmpdir}``
    the environment temporary directory
``{envlogdir}``
    the environment log directory


environment variable substitutions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you specify a substitution string like this::

    {env:KEY}

then the value will be retrieved as ``os.environ['KEY']``
and raise an Error if the environment variable
does not exist.


environment variable substitutions with default values
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you specify a substitution string like this::

    {env:KEY:DEFAULTVALUE}

then the value will be retrieved as ``os.environ['KEY']``
and replace with DEFAULTVALUE if the environment variable does not
exist.

If you specify a substitution string like this::

    {env:KEY:}

then the value will be retrieved as ``os.environ['KEY']``
and replace with and empty string if the environment variable does not
exist.

.. _`command positional substitution`:
.. _`positional substitution`:

substitutions for positional arguments in commands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 1.0

If you specify a substitution string like this::

    {posargs:DEFAULTS}

then the value will be replaced with positional arguments as provided
to the tox command::

    tox arg1 arg2

In this instance, the positional argument portion will be replaced with
``arg1 arg2``. If no positional arguments were specified, the value of
DEFAULTS will be used instead. If DEFAULTS contains other substitution
strings, such as ``{env:*}``, they will be interpreted.,

Use a double ``--`` if you also want to pass options to an underlying
test command, for example::

    tox -- --opt1 ARG1

will make the ``--opt1 ARG1`` appear in all test commands where ``[]`` or
``{posargs}`` was specified.  By default (see ``args_are_paths``
setting), ``tox`` rewrites each positional argument if it is a relative
path and exists on the filesystem to become a path relative to the
``changedir`` setting.

Previous versions of tox supported the ``[.*]`` pattern to denote
positional arguments with defaults. This format has been deprecated.
Use ``{posargs:DEFAULTS}`` to specify those.


Substitution for values from other sections
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 1.4

Values from other sections can be refered to via::

   {[sectionname]valuename}

which you can use to avoid repetition of config values.
You can put default values in one section and reference them in others to avoid repeating the same values::

    [base]
    deps =
        pytest
        mock
        pytest-xdist

    [testenv:dulwich]
    deps =
        dulwich
        {[base]deps}

    [testenv:mercurial]
    deps =
        mercurial
        {[base]deps}


Generating environments, conditional settings
---------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.8

Suppose you want to test your package against python2.6, python2.7 and against
several versions of a dependency, say Django 1.5 and Django 1.6. You can
accomplish that by writing down 2*2 = 4 ``[testenv:*]`` sections and then
listing all of them in ``envlist``.

However, a better approach looks like this::

    [tox]
    envlist = {py26,py27}-django{15,16}

    [testenv]
    basepython =
        py26: python2.6
        py27: python2.7
    deps =
        pytest
        django15: Django>=1.5,<1.6
        django16: Django>=1.6,<1.7
        py26: unittest2
    commands = py.test

This uses two new facilities of tox-1.8:

- generative envlist declarations where each envname
  consists of environment parts or "factors"

- "factor" specific settings

Let's go through this step by step.


.. _generative-envlist:

Generative envlist
+++++++++++++++++++++++

::

    envlist = {py26,py27}-django{15,16}

This is bash-style syntax and will create ``2*2=4`` environment names
like this::

    py26-django15
    py26-django16
    py27-django15
    py27-django16

You can still list environments explicitly along with generated ones::

    envlist = {py26,py27}-django{15,16}, docs, flake

.. note::

    To help with understanding how the variants will produce section values,
    you can ask tox to show their expansion with a new option::

        $ tox -l
        py26-django15
        py26-django16
        py27-django15
        py27-django16
        docs
        flake


.. _factors:

Factors and factor-conditional settings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Parts of an environment name delimited by hyphens are called factors and can
be used to set values conditionally::

    basepython =
        py26: python2.6
        py27: python2.7

This conditional setting will lead to either ``python2.6`` or
``python2.7`` used as base python, e.g. ``python2.6`` is selected if current
environment contains ``py26`` factor.

In list settings such as ``deps`` or ``commands`` you can freely intermix
optional lines with unconditional ones::

    deps =
        pytest
        django15: Django>=1.5,<1.6
        django16: Django>=1.6,<1.7
        py26: unittest2

Reading it line by line:

- ``pytest`` will be included unconditionally,
- ``Django>=1.5,<1.6`` will be included for environments containing ``django15`` factor,
- ``Django>=1.6,<1.7`` similarly depends on ``django16`` factor,
- ``unittest`` will be loaded for Python 2.6 environments.

.. note::

    Tox provides good defaults for basepython setting, so the above
    ini-file can be further reduced by omitting the ``basepython``
    setting.


Complex factor conditions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sometimes you need to specify the same line for several factors or create a
special case for a combination of factors. Here is how you do it::

    [tox]
    envlist = py{26,27,33}-django{15,16}-{sqlite,mysql}

    [testenv]
    deps =
        py33-mysql: PyMySQL     ; use if both py33 and mysql are in an env name
        py26,py27: urllib3      ; use if any of py26 or py27 are in an env name
        py{26,27}-sqlite: mock  ; mocking sqlite in python 2.x

Take a look at first ``deps`` line. It shows how you can special case something
for a combination of factors, you just join combining factors with a hyphen.
This particular line states that ``PyMySQL`` will be loaded for python 3.3,
mysql environments, e.g. ``py33-django15-mysql`` and ``py33-django16-mysql``.

The second line shows how you use same line for several factors - by listing
them delimited by commas. It's possible to list not only simple factors, but
also their combinations like ``py26-sqlite,py27-sqlite``.

Finally, factor expressions are expanded the same way as envlist, so last
example could be rewritten as ``py{26,27}-sqlite``.

.. note::

    Factors don't do substring matching against env name, instead every
    hyphenated expression is split by ``-`` and if ALL the factors in an
    expression are also factors of an env then that condition is considered
    hold.

    For example, environment ``py26-mysql``:

    - could be matched with expressions ``py26``, ``py26-mysql``,
      ``mysql-py26``,
    - but not with ``py2`` or ``py26-sql``.


Other Rules and notes
=====================

* ``path`` specifications: if a specified ``path`` is a relative path
  it will be considered as relative to the ``toxinidir``, the directory
  where the configuration file resides.
