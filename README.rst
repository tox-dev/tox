tox automation project
======================

**vision: standardize testing in Python**

tox aims to automate and standardize testing in Python. It is part of a larger vision of easing the packaging, testing and release process of Python software.

What is tox?
============

tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for:

* checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and
  interpreters

* running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice

* acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly
  reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
